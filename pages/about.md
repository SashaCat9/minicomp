_Facets_ is the team work of Angela Zoss and Alex Gil. During the lockdown, they met religiously for two hours every week. They finally met in real life once the project was almost complete. _Facets_ builds on the work of Marii Nyröp, and the cheerful encouragement of the Wax community which gathers on [a channel on the Code4Lib Slack](https://code4lib.slack.com/archives/C01DKQ44GE4).
